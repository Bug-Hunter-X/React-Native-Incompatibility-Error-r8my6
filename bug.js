This error occurs when you are using a library or module that is not compatible with React Native's environment or has a dependency conflict.  For example, you might try to use a Node.js module that relies on features unavailable in the React Native environment. Another case is when you have conflicting versions of dependencies, leading to unexpected behaviors.
